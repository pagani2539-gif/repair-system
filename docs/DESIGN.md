# Design System: Repair & Equipment Replacement Management System

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Executive Hub"**

The Repair & Equipment Replacement Management System is designed for technicians, inventory managers, IT directors, and procurement staff who operate in high-velocity corporate environments. The visual system represents efficiency, precision, and confidence. It balances professional reliability with modern visual delight through a premium **"Executive Hub"** aesthetic.

The interface rejects SaaS marketing cliches in favor of clear, dense, and structured information layouts. It presents key metrics, work progress, and inventory status via a modular **Bento Grid Dashboard**, reducing cognitive load and maximizing usability.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Glassmorphic Depth**: Global use of frosted glass backgrounds, blurs, and layered elevation shadows to create a sophisticated, high-end feel.
- **Sleek Density**: Structured grids, clean lines, and compact typography that prioritizes readability and quick scanning.
- **Bento Grid Layout**: A modular 12-column grid system for the dashboard that organizes complex analytics into distinct, interactive cards.
- **Micro-Delight**: Responsive elevation scaling, subtle background glows, and rotational transitions on interactive badges.

## 2. Colors

The color palette centers on a primary sky-blue accent combined with clean neutral backgrounds and glassmorphic layers.

### Glassmorphism
- **Glass Background** (`--glass-bg`: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)`): The base for all frosted glass panels.
- **Glass Blur** (`--glass-blur`: `blur(12px)`): Applied to headers, sidebars, and dashboard cards for depth.

### Primary
- **Active Sky Blue** (#29b6f6): The primary brand identifier. Used for key interactive controls and active navigation.
- **Hover Sky Blue** (#03a9f4): A slightly darker, more saturated shade of the primary color. Used exclusively for hovered states of primary buttons.

### Neutral
- **Slate Text Main** (#0f172a): Dark, high-contrast slate. Used for body text, table text, and headers to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA readability.
- **Muted Slate** (#64748b): Mid-tone slate. Used for secondary text, metadata labels, and inactive filters.
- **Light App Background** (#f4f6f9): Cool gray background. Serves as the main canvas background for the application.
- **White Card Background** (#ffffff): Pure white surface. Used for cards and container panels to stand out from the app background.
- **Border Slate** (#e2e8f0): Thin border color. Used to partition grids, define inputs, and segment table lines.
- **Border Hover** (#cbd5e1): A darker neutral border. Used when interactive containers or inputs are hovered.

### Status Semantic Colors
- **Danger Red** (#ef4444): Used for critical status alerts, expired dates, and destructive actions.
- **Success Green** (#10b981): Used for completed actions, active stocks, and successful operations.
- **Warning Orange** (#d97706): Used for items under review, reorder thresholds, or pending approvals.
- **Info Cyan** (#0891b2): Used for scheduled actions, stock withdrawals, and auxiliary stats.

### Named Rules
**The 10 Percent Accent Rule.** The primary blue accent (#29b6f6) is used for ≤10% of any given viewport. Brand identity is carried by clean layout spacing and purposeful semantic typography rather than blue color-drenching.

## 3. Typography

**Display Font:** Outfit (Latin headings)
**Body Font:** Sarabun (Thai and Latin body text)

The system pairs the geometric, tech-forward Outfit typeface for numbers, labels, and Latin headings, with the highly legible, formal Sarabun typeface for Thai descriptions, notes, and general table copy.

### Hierarchy
- **Display Heading** (Outfit, Bold, 2.25rem (36px), 1.2): Used for main dashboard titles and primary page-level headings.
- **Section Title** (Outfit, Semi-Bold, 1.5rem (24px), 1.3): Used for cards headers, transaction segments, and major modal headers.
- **Sub-header** (Outfit, Medium, 1.1rem (17.6px), 1.4): Used for secondary labels, KPI subheadings, and descriptive field groupings.
- **Body Copy** (Sarabun, Regular, 0.95rem (15.2px), 1.6): Used for descriptive note fields, table text, and descriptive listings. Line lengths are constrained to ≤75ch for optimal reading.
- **Interactive Label** (Outfit, Bold, 0.85rem (13.6px), 1.2, uppercase): Used for navigation links, secondary button headers, and status badges.

### Named Rules
**The Dual-Font Rule.** Any page displaying mixed language must prioritize Outfit for numbers/Latin terms and Sarabun for Thai body text to maintain aesthetic polish and high legibility.

## 4. Elevation

The system uses a subtle, layered depth model where surfaces are flat at rest and float on hover to invite interaction.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Shadow Small** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03)`): Used for static cards, tables, and standard page headers.
- **Shadow Medium** (`box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03)`): Used for hovered cards and active button states.
- **Primary Glow** (`box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(41, 182, 246, 0.2)`): Used under active primary elements and focus rings.

### Named Rules
**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** All containers and layout panels are rendered flat at rest with a 1px border. Height elevation (using translateY and medium shadows) occurs only as a reactive response to hover or focus states.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Shape**: Rounded corners with a 12px radius (var(--radius-md)).
- **Primary**: Background (#29b6f6) and white text, accompanied by primary glow. Padding is 12px 24px.
- **Hover / Focus**: Transitions using 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1). Hover lifts element (`transform: translateY(-3px)`) and darkens background to `#03a9f4` with an enhanced glow.
- **Outline**: Transparent background with Slate Text Main (#0f172a) and 1px Border Slate (#e2e8f0). Hovers fade in a light primary background tint (`rgba(41, 182, 246, 0.08)`) with a blue border shift.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Shape**: Rounded corners with a 12px radius (var(--radius-md)).
- **Standard**: White background, 1px Border Slate (#e2e8f0), padding of 12px 16px.
- **Focus**: Border shifts to primary blue (#29b6f6) with a subtle blue ring glow (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(41, 182, 246, 0.15)`).

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style**: Rounded corners with a 14px radius (var(--radius-lg)).
- **Background**: White Card Background (#ffffff) with a 1px Border Slate (#e2e8f0).
- **Interactive Hover**: Lifts container up (`transform: translateY(-6px) scale(1.01)`) and scales border to primary blue (#29b6f6).

### Navigation
- **Sidebar**: High-contrast white background (#ffffff) with a 1px Border Slate (#e2e8f0) on the right. Inactive nav links use Muted Slate (#64748b) text.
- **Active State**: Fades in a primary light background (`rgba(41, 182, 246, 0.08)`) and changes text to Slate Text Main (#0f172a) with a solid blue indicator bar.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** wrap notes and long text using `white-space: normal` and `word-break: break-word` inside tables to avoid truncation.
- **Do** align numerical values and action headers to the right of data tables to maintain structured tracking.
- **Do** use Outfit for Latin characters, numbers, and KPI stats, while using Sarabun for Thai translations and notes.
- **Do** use responsive grids with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for fluid layouts without rigid media queries.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use colored side-stripes or borders thicker than 1px on one side of a card, list item, or callout (e.g. no `border-left: 4px solid ...` as accents).
- **Don't** use text gradients (`background-clip: text`) for headers; keep text solid for readability.
- **Don't** overuse em-dashes (— or --) in user-facing Thai copy. Use commas, colons, or parentheses.
- **Don't** animate width, height, padding, or margin properties for sidebar collapse transitions (use transform or discrete flex values to prevent layout thrashing).
- **Don't** nest cards inside other card containers. Use borderless grids for secondary sub-items.
